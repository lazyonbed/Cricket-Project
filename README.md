# Decision Review System (DRS) data analysis - IPL 2024

In this repository, I analyze the reviews taken by captains during IPL 2024. I collect the dataset from ESPNCricinfo manually everyday (I know it's stupid. But it's pretty quick to be honest. I wish to write a script sometime soon though).

### Required Libraries:
1. Pandas
2. Seaborn
3. Matplotlib

I create separate jupyter notebooks for each question I try to answer. I will create one question per day. I will start with basic ones and continue to build. I will also update the notebooks everyday to reflect the latest results. 

### Questions answered
1. Day 1: How many reviews were taken per innings?
2. Day 2: How many reviews were taken each over?
3. Day 3: What kind of decisions are being challenged?
