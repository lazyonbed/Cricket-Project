# Decision Review System (DRS) data analysis - IPL 2024

To Do:
1. I don't know how many decisions an umpire has given in a game. I am only analyzing the decisions that were challenged.

In this repository, I analyze the reviews taken by captains during IPL 2024. I collect the dataset from ESPNCricinfo manually everyday (I know it's stupid. But it's pretty quick to be honest. I wish to write a script sometime soon though).

### Required Libraries:
1. Pandas
2. Seaborn
3. Matplotlib

I create separate jupyter notebooks for each question I try to answer. I will create one question per day. I will start with basic ones and continue to build. I will also update the notebooks everyday to reflect the latest results. 

### Questions answered
1. Day 1: In the 1st innings, how many reviews were taken? In the 2nd innings, how many reviews were taken?
2. Day 2: How many reviews were taken in each over over all games?
3. Day 3: There are 3 kinds of umpiring decisions being challenged: Wide, Wicket, NoBall. How many challenges for each of them?
4. Day 4: There are 2 sides each innings: Batting and Fielding? Which side challenged the highest share of reviews?
5. Day 5: Umpires accuracy!!!
